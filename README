Variable-Lazy

This module implements lazy variables. It's different from other similar modules in that it works *completely* transparant: there is no way to see from the outside that the variable was lazy, and there is no speed penalty once the variable has been evaluated.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install
